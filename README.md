Description: The increasing crime rate and the need for efficient criminal identification and prevention have led to the adoption of security technologies such as CCTV cameras. In this study, we propose an automated facial recognition system using the Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) classifier and Fisherface algorithm. The system utilizes a Haar feature- based cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time, and the iden- tified faces are then matched against a criminal database. Although accurate face identification remains a challenge, the Viola-Jones frame- work is utilized to pinpoint face positions and other features in a picture. Face detection classifiers are publicly available through organi- zations like OpenCV. Our proposed system has the potential to enhance criminal identification and prevention in public and private spaces.
